# Inventory Automation Project - Orchestration Design

## Overview
This document outlines the design and implementation strategy for fully automating the inventory management pipeline using the existing agents and identified improvements.

## Master Workflow Design

### Objective
To create a cohesive, orchestrated pipeline that handles the entire lifecycle of product data processing, from image analysis to catalog integration, with minimal human intervention.

### General Approach
1. **Sequential Execution** - Integrate each agent's tasks into a sequence flow.
2. **Error Handling and Recovery** - Include mechanisms for retry logic and fallback methods.
3. **Metrics and Monitoring** - Embed observability to track performance and identify bottlenecks.

### Workflow Steps
1. **Image Analysis**
   - **Input**: Raw image files identified for processing.
   - **Agent**: `ImageAnalysisAgent`.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Analyze and extract product metadata.
     - Save results for further processing.
     - Report errors and retry as needed.

2. **Product Grouping and Categorization**
   - **Agent**: `GroupingAgent`.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Group products based on metadata similarity.
     - Assign provisional categories.
     - Validate category assignments.

3. **Filename Normalization**
   - **Agent**: `FileNamingAgent`.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Generate SEO-friendly filenames.
     - Apply changes to file system if approved.
     - Backup originals.

4. **Catalog Synchronization**
   - **Agent**: `SquareCatalogAgent`.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Sync analyzed items with Square catalog.
     - Automatic assignment of images to items.
     - Continuous syncing and micro-adjustments.

5. **Inventory Monitoring and Alerts**
   - **Tasks**:
     - Monitor stock levels and alert when thresholds are breached.
     - Trigger reorders or other corrective actions via API/webhooks.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. Pipeline Orchestration
- **Tool**: Node.js with CLI Commands
- **API Integration**: OpenAI, Square v43.0.1 SDK

#### 2. Error Handling
- **Strategy**: Retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Fallbacks**: Default handlers for non-critical failures

#### 3. Monitoring
- **Metrics**: Use `PrometheusMetrics` or similar for dashboard
- **Alerts**: Integrate with Slack/E-mail for real-time alerts

#### 4. Configuration
- **Files**: `config/workflow.config.js`
- **Parameters**:
  - Concurrency limits
  - Retry thresholds
  - Timeout settings

### Next Steps and Validation
1. **Build a Prototype** - Create a proof-of-concept orchestrator.
2. **Validation** - Run automated tests to validate new workflows.
3. **Deployment** - Rollout in incremental steps to ensure stability.

This design will serve as the basis for converting discrete automated processes into a seamless, continuous workflow, reducing operational overhead and enhancing reliability.
