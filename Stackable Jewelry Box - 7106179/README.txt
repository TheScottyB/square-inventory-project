Summary:
Everyone has a bit of jewelry. Some have a little. Some have more. Some have a lot. But some have more than a lot. So I made a stackable jewelry box with a locking latch to keep your piles of gold organized and safe.Please see my post on Makerworld at https://makerworld.com/en/models/1658394-stackable-jewelry-box#profileId-1754064 for detailed assembly instructions with pictures. Have a great day!
