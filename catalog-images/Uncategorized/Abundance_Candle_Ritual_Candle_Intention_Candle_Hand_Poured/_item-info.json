  "description": "This powerful intention candle is for the purpose of abundance in one's life, specifically in the monetary form. It is to be lit with love and gratitude focusing on the blessings you would be grateful to receive. Be open and have a grateful heart.\n\nThis candle is 4 oz of hand-poured soy wax in a glass jar with a metal lid. This candle has a wood wick and is infused with our proprietary blend of organic essential oils to promote abundance, wealth, and blessings. This is our own tried and true recipe and we have always received unexpected blessings when using this blend. Use it sparingly. We've topped it with herbs that are known to attract money. The peppermint symbolizes the green of money, the poppyseeds are said to attract luck and money but my favorite of this combo is the Ceylon cinnamon. Cinnamon is said to bring in cash quickly but also protects and promotes healing, what a wonderful spice. We've topped it all with a citrine crystal, the crystal of prosperity. We are not promising anything but this combination has always worked for us <3\n\nThis candle is a wonderful accompaniment to meditation and reflection upon life's blessings. Abundance comes to those with gratitude. This candle was made with warm and loving heart energy.\n\nThis listing is for 1 blessings candle. The candle is part of the crystal collection and is 3 of 6.
