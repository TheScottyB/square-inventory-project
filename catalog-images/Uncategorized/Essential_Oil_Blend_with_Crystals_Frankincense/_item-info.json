  "name": "Essential Oil Blend with Crystals Frankincense",
  "description": "LIMITED EDITION This is one of my favorite things yet. I found these crystal pieces on a trip to Napa and knew they were something special. Each blend has a quartz and agate crystal, a piece of frankincense resin, Palo santo wood and hibiscus flowers. The purpose of this blend is grounding for deeper meditation or other spiritual practice. This particular blend of essential oils was designed around spiritual practice and whatever denomination that is to you. The contents are suspended in an organic jojoba oil so that you can easily roll onto your pressure points and it will soak right in.",
