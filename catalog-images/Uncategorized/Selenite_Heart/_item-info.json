  "description": "Selenite Heart\n\nTo vibrate at their peak potential, your crystals require cleansing and charging. A Selenite Charging Plate can be a valuable tool for this purpose. Unlike other crystals, Selenite doesn’t need charging; instead, it amplifies the energy of all crystals placed upon it.\n\nThe pure, high-vibrational energy of Selenite is akin to pure white light. It possesses the remarkable ability to cleanse, purify, and align you with your highest potential. By shifting your aura and energetic vibration, Selenite helps you attune yourself to a higher energy level. Conversely, low-vibrational energies tend to attract negativity. Raising your vibration is crucial in keeping feelings of grief, fear, anger, and anxiety out of your mental and physical space. If you’ve been actively working with crystals during times of stress or emotional turmoil, don’t forget to release that energy from them using Selenite.\n\nSelenite also provides protection from the angelic realm, helping to dispel all negative energy from your body and mind. It is renowned for bringing deep peace and mental clarity. These Selenite Charging Plates and bowls can magnify the energy of anything placed upon them. Additionally, you can combine them with other crystals to amplify the desired intention.",
