  "description": "Super soft, stretchy, and comfortable yoga leggings. Order these to make sure your next yoga session is the best one ever!\n\n\n• 82% polyester, 18% spandex\n\n• Four-way stretch, which means fabric stretches and recovers on the cross and lengthwise grains.\n\n• Made with a smooth, comfortable microfiber yarn\n\n• Raised waistband \n\n• Precision-cut and hand-sewn after printing\n\n\nDisclaimers:\n\n• In areas where the fabric is double-layered (like pockets), details from the inner fabric layer may subtly show through, especially with lighter designs.\n\n• Please note that contact with rough surfaces should be avoided since they can pull out the white fibers in the fabric, damaging the leggings.\n\n\nThis product is made especially for you as soon as you place an order, which is why it takes us a bit longer to deliver it to you. Making products on demand instead of in bulk helps reduce overproduction, so thank you for making thoughtful purchasing decisions!",
