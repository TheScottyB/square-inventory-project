  "description": "<p>Handmade welded metal roses with a vase create the perfect gift. This is six of our up-cycled roses and a vase made from recycled materials including washers, tubing, and wire welded together creating beautiful art. Each rose is an individual and a little different all created from the same materials. The washers are all hand bent and welded together to create a beautiful welded art rose that will never die. This gift would be great for Weddings, Anniversaries, Valentine's Day or just a great way to say you are sorry. Please keep in mind this is for a half dozen roses. They will differ slightly from the image as each one is handcrafted depending on the availability of similar components creating the same size result and similar looking product. Included will be a tag attached to one of the roses with jute cord. Every one of our items is cleaned up to have the sharp edges removed. They are then sprayed with a clear lacquer to give a continuous shine and prevent any type of rust.</p><p>The modern and traditional 11th Wedding Anniversary gifts are steel. There is no better gift than some awesome stainless steel roses.</p><p>This item is handcrafted in the United States of America.</p><p>View more of our products at</p><p>#Country #ForeverRose #Handmade #MetalRelic #Recycled #Rustic #ScrapArt #Scrapture #Steel #Upcycled #Wedding #Anniversary #Welder Gift #Welding Art #Valentine's Day Gift #Valentine Decor</p>",
