  "description": "Selenite sticks are ideal for recharging and cleansing all your crystals. Simply place your small crystals on top of the selenite and leave it for at least 6 hours.\n\nThis item can also help alleviate aches and pains, including headaches, muscle soreness, and tightness, as well as insomnia. Lie down, take deep breaths, and exhale at least three times. Gently place the selenite directly on the affected area, relax (close your eyes, meditate, or set an intention for the selenite), and allow it to work for at least 15-20 minutes. This stone may help absorb negative energy.\n\nPlease note:\n- This information is not intended as medical advice.\n- Please read our disclaimer regarding crystals and any medical claims/information provided on this site.\n- Do not take the information contained here in lieu of medical advice.\n\nImportant:\n- Each selenite stick is sold separately.\n- Keep your selenite away from water or moisture, as it can disintegrate.\n- Please note that there are imperfections in each natural stone due to hand-cutting in Morocco.\n\nDimensions:\n- 4” x 1” x 1/2”\n\nOrigin:\n- Morocco",
