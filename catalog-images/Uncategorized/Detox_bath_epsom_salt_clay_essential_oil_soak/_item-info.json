  "description": "This amazing bath soak will do just about anything. Made from detoxifying Betonite clay and Epsom salts, these will relax and pull toxins from your body. Whether you're starting a new diet, had a rough weekend or are sick, this is the detox for you. An added umph comes from the lovely Frankincense and Lavender essential oils to ease your body, mind and spirit. I use this when I'm sick and feel AMAZING afterwards. Safe for children too. This is for one 8 oz. glass jar that can be reused or recycled. Good for one detoxifying bath. Shop Info: We believe that your skin is just as vital as any other organ in your body.
