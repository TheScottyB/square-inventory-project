  "name": "🎶 Remember How Great...? – 1961 Lucky Strike Collector’s Vinyl LP",
  "description": "Step back into the golden age of jazz and big band with this rare collector’s item. Released in 1961 by Columbia Records, “Remember How Great...?” is a 12-inch vinyl LP featuring original recordings from legendary artists. What makes this album truly unique is its origin—it was custom-pressed exclusively for Lucky Strike Cigarettes as part of a promotional campaign.\n🎷 Tracklist Highlights\nLouis Armstrong – St. Louis Blues\nCount Basie – One O'Clock Jump\nDinah Shore – Buttons and Bows\nDuke Ellington – Mood Indigo\nCab Calloway – Blues in the Night\nLes Brown – Sentimental Journey\nTommy Dorsey – I Dream of You\nXavier Cugat – Brazil\nEddy Duchin – Stardust\nHarry James – Ciribiribin\nAndre Kostelanetz – Night and Day\nMary Martin – My Heart Belongs to Daddy\nEach track is an original recording, capturing the essence of an era that continues to inspire.\n🕰️ Album Details\nTitle: Remember How Great...?\nLabel: Columbia Record Productions\nFormat: 12-inch Vinyl LP\nRelease Year: 1961\nEdition: Custom-pressed for Lucky Strike Cigarettes\nCatalog Number: XTV 66639 / XTV 66640\nPressing Plant: Columbia Records Pressing Plant, Pitman, NJ\nGenre: Big Band, Easy Listening, Traditional Vocals\nSpeed: 33 RPM\nCondition: Please refer to product photos or contact us directly for specific grading.\n\n💡 Why This Album Stands Out\nThis LP isn't just a collection of songs; it's a piece of history. The collaboration between Columbia Records and Lucky Strike Cigarettes led to a unique promotional item that wasn't available in stores. Customers could obtain the album for $1 plus 10 empty packs of Lucky Strike cigarettes—a marketing strategy that has since made this LP a sought-after collector's item.
