# Advanced Observability System - Implementation Summary

## üéâ Achievement: All Tests Passing!

The advanced observability system for the Square Catalog Agent has been successfully implemented and tested. All 6 test suites are passing with comprehensive coverage of next-level observability features.

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. **OpenTelemetry Integration** (`OpenTelemetryObserver.js`)
- **Adaptive Trace Sampling**: Dynamic sampling rates based on operation type and error conditions
- **Rich Custom Spans**: Detailed span attributes with merchant context, operation metadata, and error classification
- **Sensitive Data Scrubbing**: Automatic removal of PII and sensitive information from traces
- **Trace-Log Correlation**: Injection of trace IDs into structured logs
- **Force Sampling**: Ability to override sampling for debugging specific operations

### 2. **Prometheus Metrics** (`PrometheusMetrics.js`)
- **Golden Signals Monitoring**: Latency, Traffic, Errors, and Saturation metrics
- **Per-Merchant Metrics**: Merchant-specific counters and histograms
- **SLI/SLO Tracking**: Budget consumption tracking for latency and error thresholds
- **Node.js Resource Metrics**: Event loop lag, heap size, and CPU monitoring
- **Alerting Rules**: Comprehensive Prometheus/Alertmanager rule definitions
- **Grafana Dashboard**: Pre-configured dashboard for visualization

### 3. **Version Drift Monitoring** (`VersionDriftMonitor.js`)
- **Catalog Version Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of Square catalog version changes
- **Expected Change Management**: Ability to mark version changes as expected
- **Canary Operations**: Lightweight API health checks to detect behavioral changes
- **Anomaly Detection**: Analysis of canary results for unusual patterns
- **Alert Generation**: Automated alerts for unexpected version changes

### 4. **Advanced Observability Agent** (`AdvancedObservabilityAgent.js`)
- **Unified Interface**: Single integration point for all observability features
- **Cross-Layer Correlation**: Unified tracing across OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, and legacy systems
- **Health Checks**: Comprehensive system health monitoring
- **Dashboard Integration**: Unified observability dashboard
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup of all observability components

## üîß Key Technical Fixes Applied

### 1. **Label Management**
- **Problem**: Prometheus metrics received extra labels not defined in labelsets
- **Solution**: Filtered attributes to only pass core labels (`merchantId` ‚Üí `merchant_id`) to Prometheus while preserving full context for OpenTelemetry

### 2. **Version Drift Detection**
- **Problem**: Expected changes were being marked as unexpected due to double consumption
- **Solution**: Modified `isExpectedChange()` to support non-consuming checks and proper expected change tracking

### 3. **Metrics Collection**
- **Problem**: `getCurrentMetrics()` failed when `getMetricsAsJSON()` didn't return an array
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling and support for both array and object metric responses

### 4. **Module Import Issues**
- **Problem**: CommonJS/ESM import conflicts with OpenTelemetry and Prometheus libraries
- **Solution**: Used proper import syntax (`import * as` for CommonJS modules)

### 5. **Metric Registration Conflicts**
- **Problem**: Duplicate metric registration between default and custom Node.js metrics
- **Solution**: Renamed custom metrics to avoid conflicts (`square_nodejs_*` prefix)

## üìä Test Results

All 6 test suites are passing:

1. ‚úÖ **Advanced Observability Init** - Component initialization and setup
2. ‚úÖ **Prometheus Metrics** - Metrics collection and export (224 lines, 38 metric families, 5 alert rules)
3. ‚úÖ **Version Drift Monitoring** - Version tracking and change detection (4 history entries, 1 expected alert)
4. ‚úÖ **Integrated Operation Tracing** - End-to-end operation tracing with error handling
5. ‚úÖ **Dashboard and Health Check** - System health monitoring (3 components, healthy status)
6. ‚úÖ **Enhanced Logging** - Structured logging with context correlation
