Do not soak in the water for long periods. It is natural for these vibrant patterns to have a little color come out for the first few times when you wash them. After that you will be able to mix with other clothes without any issue. You can also wash these separately in the washer on a delicate cycle. We recommend you put them in a garment bag to protect the feel and elasticity of the pants\n. --------------------------------------------------------------\nðŸ‘–Your Harem Pants\nLoose and supremely comfortable Harem Pants.
