  "description": "This is tarot deck and book that will help you plumb the depths of your soul, expose the powerful even frightening aspects of the human psyche, and teach you to cultivate self-realization. Arthur Taussig, the creator of the Alchemical Visions Tarot, is a renowned artist and polymath: a physicist, photographer, filmmaker, and musician whose artwork has been exhibited in 300 exhibitions worldwide. His complex imagery explores the theme of the Hero’s Journey throughout the major and minor arcana and reveals often overlooked psychological implications of many of the tarot archetypes. Each card is presented as a key to cultivating self-awareness and self-realization. While the Alchemical Visions Tarot falls in the tradition of the Waite and Marseilles decks, it moves past preconceived notions of race of and gender. It is a deck that all serious tarot enthusiasts and spiritual seekers will want to explore for themselves. Comes in a 5\" x 7\" Silver box with a window showing picture and contains 78 oversized cards and a 192 page book.",
