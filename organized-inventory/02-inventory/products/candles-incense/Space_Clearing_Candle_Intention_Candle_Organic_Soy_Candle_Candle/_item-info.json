  "description": "Meet Clear S\n\nThis candle in the intention setting set will help you begin a new journey, end a chapter or just clear the funk. Great for new homes, offices or cleansing your space. It can also be burned in your space to keep others energy from entering it or rubbing off on you. \n\nMade with hand-poured soy wax with extra long burning time, this candle is to be set with intention and peace. Clears negative energy, absorbs \"bad vibes\" and resets the energy of a space. Topped with palo santo and frankincense resin, these two elements can be burned simultaneously on top of the candle or even next to the candle on a plate. Palo Santo has been used for centuries to cleanse energy and provide luck and healing to those who use it. Frankincense, a relative of Palo Santo, assists in removing negative energy from a space, provides protection and creates an elevated spiritual awareness. The pink sea salt aids in absorbing and cleansing the negativity. \n\n The essential oil blend we have chosen for this candle is very powerful. It's a blend of Lemon, Lavender, and Cedarwood. Lavender clears out energies that will not leave a space. Traditionally used to neutralize bad frequencies during cleansing rituals. Lavender is also known to be relaxing, so having it in a room before a social event can prevent negative energy before it starts. Cedarwood is grounding and can give strength if the energy field is under attack. The lemon dispels negative energy while also attracting joy. \n\n Lastly, this candle is topped with a quartz crystal. I always call quartz the \"jack of all crystals\" as it does everything. It purifies the aura and cleanses a room. My recommendation would be to circle the crystal in your energy field several times, then move it about the room. You can cleanse your crystal afterward by placing it in a glass of saltwater. \n\n\nThis listing is for 1 space clearing candle. The candle is part of the crystal collection and is 4 of 6. Full set will include: 1 blessing, 1 abundance, 1 peace, 1 love spell, 1 grief, and 1 space clearing candle.\n\n*Essential oil candles are a muted scent. There is no synthetic fragrance oil in our candles.*\n\nShop Info: \n\nWe believe that your skin is just as vital as any other organ in your body.
