  "description": "<p>Handmade welded metal roses create the perfect gift. Single up-cycled rose made from recycled washers and wire welded together creating beautiful art. Each rose is an individual and a little different all created from the same materials. The washers are all hand bent and welded together to create a beautiful welded art rose that will never die. This gift would be great for Weddings, Anniversaries, Valentine's Day, or just a great way to say you are sorry. Please keep in mind this is for one rose only and it will differ slightly from the image. Each one is handcrafted depending on the availability of similar components creating the same size result and similar looking product. Included will be a tag attached to the item with a jute cord. Every single rose is cleaned up and the sharp edges removed, they are then powder coated to give a continuous shine and prevent any type of rust. </p>\n<p>The head is a lustrous green and the stem is matte black.</p>\n<p>They are packaged in a crystal clear box perfect for gifting.</p>\n<p>The modern and traditional 11th Wedding Anniversary gifts are steel. There is no better gift than some awesome stainless steel roses.</p>\n<p>This item is handcrafted in the United States of America.</p>\n<p>View more of our products at MetalRelic!
