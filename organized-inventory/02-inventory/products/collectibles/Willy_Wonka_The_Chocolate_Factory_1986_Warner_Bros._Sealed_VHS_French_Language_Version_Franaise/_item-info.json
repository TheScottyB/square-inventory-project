  "description": "A Golden Ticket in Shrinkwrap.\nThis is a factory-sealed, first-release 1986 Warner Bros. French-language VHS copy of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. It’s not just rare—it’s the kind of rare that gets whisper-listed among VHS collectors.\n\n\n🎬 About the Tape\nThis version of Willy Wonka was custom-distributed for the French-speaking market and is labeled “Version Française” on the original clamshell case. It features:\nOriginal 1986 Warner Bros. release\nFactory seal still intact\nClassic artwork with Gene Wilder front and center\nFull-length French-dubbed audio (NTSC format)\nAuthentic vintage pricing stickers still attached (adds character + provenance)\nUnlike reissues from the 1990s, this is the true early home video edition, pressed during VHS’s golden age—back when your local rental store was a portal to magic.\n\n\n🏷️ Why This Tape Is Special\nFactory-sealed status is nearly unheard of for this title and year—most were opened, played, and worn out decades ago.\nThe French-language variant was likely produced in much smaller numbers than the U.S. English editions.\nThese international market tapes are often the last to survive sealed—and the first to disappear into private collections.\nA non-sealed 1986 copy of this film sold for over $3,100 on eBay in 2023. Let that sink in.\nAnd this one? It’s still sealed.\n\n\n🔍 Condition\nSeal: Fully intact with no rips or tears\nCase: Light shelfwear from age, but otherwise pristine\nTape: Unplayed. Virgin magnetic memory inside.\nLabeling: Includes “Version Française” mark and original barcode sticker\nBonus: Vintage store price tag still attached for added authenticity\nThis tape has not been graded, but it's being stored as if it were—a candidate for CGC or PSA VHS grading if the future owner wishes to pursue it.\n\n\n💡 Collector Notes\nGenre: Musical / Fantasy\nRuntime: Approx. 100 mins\nFormat: VHS (NTSC)\nLanguage: French\nYear: 1986 (VHS release), film originally released in 1971\nStudio: Warner Bros. Home Video\n\n\n🛍️ My Promise to You\nWe specialize in small-batch, high-touch retail, and that includes rare collectibles like this one. If you have questions, we are here. If it’s not the right fit, we’ll work it out—Costco-style.\n\n\nThis item ships insured, boxed, and packed with care.\nIf you'd like to discuss grading, layaway, or specialty shipping (military/APO addresses, international forwarding, etc.), just message me.\n\n\n📦 What’s Included\n1 × Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory 1986 Sealed French VHS\n1 × Handwritten provenance certificate (upon request)\n1 × Layer of vintage magic\n\n\n🎟️ Asking Price: $2,495\n(Firm. Grading considered upon inquiry. May increase if graded.)\n\n\nThis isn’t just a VHS—it’s a conversation starter, a time capsule, a future auction headline.\nGot questions? I’m here.",
