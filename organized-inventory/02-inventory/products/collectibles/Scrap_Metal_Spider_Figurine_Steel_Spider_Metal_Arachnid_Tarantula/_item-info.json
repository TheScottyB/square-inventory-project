  "description": "<p>This is a handmade scrap metal spider. The body of this arachnid is crafted from a bearing race and a socket with a bent washer on the bottom welded together. The eyes are a chain link welded to a nut and the legs are all made from wire. This is the perfect guardian for your desk or the perfect gift for the spider fan. It is realistic enough at first glance to scare the heck out of any unsuspecting individual.</p>\n<p>This is pretty heavy and it is metal. The sharp edges have all been cleaned up and the entire spider is sprayed with a clear polyurethane finish to help protect against rusting.</p>\n<p>This item is handcrafted in the United States of America.</p>\n<p>View more of our products at </p>\n<p>#Creepy #Handmade #MetalRelic #Recycled #Rustic #ScrapArt #Scrapture #Steel #Upcycled #Halloween #Welder Gift #Welding Art #Spiders #Home Decor #Welded</p>",
